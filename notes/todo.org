Entity system
- think I want components so we can have talking trees and such
- so I guess we want a Substance/Element component (wood, )
- and does a tree/rock/pool just become a thing with a Sprite + Body + Element? Because if we want a wish like "turn trees into rocks" we can do that with entities, but it's a bit weirder for "turn all wood into stone" 
  - I think those wishes aren't super interesting tho, things that move items/characters/world is much more interesting
Per-screen levels
Collisions
- acceleration structure
Chemistry engine
Player actions: fire bow
CPU pixel shaders sound cute
Animations
Arrow ammo for scrambly feel
